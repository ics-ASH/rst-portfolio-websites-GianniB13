  <body><br>Everything I Learn Each Week:
  <p>  Week One:
    
  </p>We watched a movie called The Imimitation Game, it was about WW2 and the process of cracking enigma to save lives and win the war.
It was a very interesting movie I rate it 8/10.
<p>  Week Two:
We began week two by setting up Mr.Jamieson's laptops and downloading a bunch of apps. We have been mainly working on our websites.
